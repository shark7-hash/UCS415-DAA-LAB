# DAA_assignment
This repository contains my Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) assignments.

# File Naming Convention
I have followed a simple naming scheme for my files:
A1Q11 → Assignment 1, Question 1
A1Q2 → Assignment 1, Question 2
A2Q1 → Assignment 2, Question 1
A2AQ2→ Assignment 2, Additional Question 2
A3AQ2→ Assignment 3, Additional Question 2
…and so on.
This makes it easy to identify which assignment and question a file corresponds to.

# Language Used:
All assignments are coded in C++.
